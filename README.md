# DomainIPInfo
Get the current IP address of a domain



Use the lookupAdd.py file with the address.txt file (the address.txt file should have a list of domains that you want the IP address for). 

Simple usage:
From the terminal:
  python lookupAdd.py
  
  
 After the script runs you can find the full results in the lookup.txt file or you can skip to just the IPv4 addresses in the awkedlookup.txt file
